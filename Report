### 💡2.3 Comparison of Hyperparameter Optimization Methods

>The data table summarizes results from `cnn/experiment_results.csv` and `cnn/RESULTS_REPORT.md`, showcasing comparisons of different hyperparameter combinations:

**Table 2.1: Learning Rate vs. Accuracy** (Fixed Kernel=3, Layers=2)
| Learning Rate | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.0001 | 98.81% | 98.95% |
| **0.001** | **99.11%** | **99.31%** |
| 0.01 | 11.22% | 11.35% |

*Findings: A learning rate of 0.01 is too high, preventing the model from converging. 0.001 is the optimal choice.*

**Table 2.2: Kernel Size vs. Accuracy**(Fixed LR=0.001, Layers=2)

| Convolution Kernel Size | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 | 99.11% | 99.31% |
| 5 | 99.24% | 99.27% |
| 7 | 99.28% | 99.31% |

*Findings: Convolution kernel size has little impact on final performance, though larger kernels (5 or 7) appear to marginally improve validation set performance.*

**Table 2.3: Number of Layers vs. Accuracy** (Fixed Kernel=3, LR=0.001)
| Number of Convolutional Layers | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 | **99.11%** | **99.31%** |
| 3 | **99.24%** | **99.35%** |

*Findings: Adding a third convolutional layer significantly improved the model's final performance.*
